# 🏦 Beta Bank Customer Churn Prediction (Supervised Learning)

## 📌 Overview
This project builds machine learning models to predict customer churn for Beta Bank. Using demographic data, account history, and customer behavior features, the goal is to help the bank identify clients at risk of leaving and support retention strategies.

## ✨ Features
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Class imbalance handling (upsampling/downsampling)  
- Multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Hyperparameter tuning  
- Model evaluation using ROC-AUC, accuracy, recall, precision  
- Feature importance insights  

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python 3.10+  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📊 Key Insights (Summary)
- Class imbalance significantly impacts model performance  
- Upsampling and downsampling both improve churn detection  
- Random Forest and Logistic Regression often perform well after tuning  
- Specific behavioral features strongly correlate with churn risk
